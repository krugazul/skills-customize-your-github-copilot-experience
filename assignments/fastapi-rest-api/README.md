# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. Practice designing endpoints, handling requests and responses, and working with data models.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Create a Simple FastAPI Application

#### Description

- Install and import FastAPI
- Create an app instance
- Define a root endpoint (GET /) that returns a welcome message
- Run the server locally


### 🛠️	Design CRUD Endpoints for a Resource

Completed program should:

- Define a data model using Pydantic
- Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Return clear responses and handle errors gracefully


### 🛠️	(Optional) Add Data Persistence
# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. Practice designing endpoints, handling requests, and returning JSON responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️  Create a Simple FastAPI API

#### Description
Build a FastAPI application with at least two endpoints. One endpoint should return a welcome message, and another should return data from a Python dictionary or list.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Use FastAPI to create an API
- Include at least two GET endpoints
- Return JSON responses
- Run locally and be accessible via browser or curl

### 🛠️  Add Data Manipulation Endpoints

#### Description
Extend your API to allow users to add, update, or delete items in your data structure using POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Implement POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints
- Validate incoming data
- Return appropriate success/error messages
- Update the data structure based on user requests

### 🛠️  (Optional) API Documentation and Error Handling

#### Description
Enhance your API with automatic documentation and robust error handling.

#### Requirements
Completed program could:

- Use FastAPI's built-in docs (Swagger UI)
- Handle errors gracefully and return helpful messages
- Add more endpoints or features as desired
#### Requirements
Completed program could:

- Store items in a persistent way
- Allow data to remain available between server restarts
- Document your API using FastAPI's automatic docs (Swagger UI)
